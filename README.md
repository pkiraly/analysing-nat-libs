# Analysing library catalogues

This repository is a kind of extension to [QA catalogue](https://github.com/pkiraly/metadata-qa-marc). It is main purpuse is to analyse data extracted from records indexed with QA catalogue. First one have to extract information, store them to CSV files, then run scripts in this repository to generate images.

The intention of it is to support research papers, so momentary I do not plan to provide detailed instructions how to use.
